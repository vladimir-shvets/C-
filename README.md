# C#
Welcome! At this folder you can see my C# projects, which I have made during classes in IT-STEP. 
Here I have two projects of reader implemenation(fb2 reader) with option to open images. They works as follows:
1. Find a book(fb2)
2. Read it
3. Ability to change the font color, background color.


Also here I have a program, which I have done at the request of my friend. This program works as follows:
1. Log in to the web-site with your account
2. Choose desirable data in googledoc
3. Find it at search-engine
4. Parse number of found requests back to the GoogleDoc, but to the other column.
